Welcome to molecool's documentation!
=========================================================
molecool is a Python package designed to read in, perfom analysis,
and visualize molecular coordinates. The file formats `xyz` and `pdb` are 
currently supported. 

We don't actually recommend use of this package as it's for illustrative purposes for MolSSI's workshop on `Best Practices
in Python package development <https://molssi-education.github.io/CMS-Python-DevOps/>`_! 

If you want to do visualization or analysis of molecular data in Python, there are libraries like `MDAnalsis <https://www.mdanalysis.org/>`_ or 
`NGLView <http://nglviewer.org/nglview/latest/api.html>`_.
